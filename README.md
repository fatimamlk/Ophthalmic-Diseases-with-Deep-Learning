# Ophthalmic Diseases with Deep Learning

## Description
This project focuses on using deep learning techniques to diagnose ophthalmic diseases from medical images. The goal is to develop a model that assists healthcare professionals by providing accurate predictions based on retinal images.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- NumPy

### Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/fatimamlk/Ophthalmic-Diseases-with-Deep-Learning.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Ophthalmic-Diseases-with-Deep-Learning
    ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset by placing your images in the `data/` directory.
2. Run the model training script:
    ```bash
    python train_model.py
    ```
3. To make predictions on new images, use the following command:
    ```bash
    python predict.py --image_path path_to_your_image.jpg
    ```

## Features
- **Model Training:** Utilizes deep learning models to train on ophthalmic datasets.
- **Prediction:** Provides predictions for new images using the trained model.
- **Visualization:** Includes tools to visualize the training process and results.
